# Algorithm examples 

---

These files **DO NOT** use the library/wrapper to sort the datasets.

They are examples of sorting kaggle datasets and randomized numbers as datasets with the original implimentations of the algorithm.

From testing (in this github and not) it shows that my algorithm comes a bit slower to popular algorithms for larger datasets but can win the race in smaller datasets.
